% Genesis 1
\section{第一章}

% The Creation

\subsection*{创世}

% In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\N 起初上帝创造诸天和地。
% Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\N 现在地是混沌空虚的，黑暗在深渊的表面之上，而上帝的圣灵在诸水上盘旋着。

\subsubsection*{第一日}

% And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
\N 而上帝说，“让那有光”，就有了光。
% God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
\N 上帝见那光是善的，祂就将光从黑暗分离。
% God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
\N 上帝称那光为“白昼”，而那黑暗祂称为“黑夜。”

然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第一日。

\subsubsection*{第二日}

% And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.”
\N 而上帝说，“让那诸水之间有穹苍将水和水分离。”
% So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so.
\N 所以上帝制造那穹苍并将它之下的诸水与之上的诸水分离。而它就如此。
% God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
\N 上帝称穹苍为“天空。”

然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第二日。

\subsubsection*{第三日}

% And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so.
\N 而上帝说，“让天空之下的诸水被聚集到一个地方，以使旱地能显现。”而它就如此。
% God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
\N 上帝称那旱地为“大地”，而诸水聚集处祂称为“海洋。”而上帝见它是善的。

% Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so.
\N 然后上帝说，“让大地生出植被：结种子的植物和结带种子果实的果树，各按其类。”而它就如此。
% The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
\N 大地产出植被：结种子的植物各从其类，而结带种子的果实的树各从其类。而上帝见它是善的。

% And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
\N 然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第三日。

\subsubsection*{第四日}
% And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night, and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years.
\N 而上帝说，“让那有光体在天空的穹苍中，以在白昼和黑夜之间作区别，并让它们成为标明季节、日子、年岁的记号。
% And let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.
\N 并让它们在天空的穹苍中充当光体，以照耀在大地之上。”而它就如此。

% God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. And He made the stars as well.
\N 上帝制造了两个巨大的光体：较大的光体统管白昼而较小的光体统管黑夜。而祂夜制造了星辰。

% God set these lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth,
\N 上帝将这些光体设置在天空的穹苍中，照耀在大地之上，
% to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
\N 掌管白昼和黑夜，并将光从黑暗分离。而上帝见它是善的。

% And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
\N 然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第四日。

\subsubsection*{第五日}

% And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”
\N 而上帝说，“让诸水以生灵充盈，并让鸟类飞翔大地之上在天空开阔的穹苍中。”
% So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according to their kinds, and every winged bird after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\N 所以上帝创造了巨大的海洋生物和每个活动的活物，诸水以它们充盈各从其类，并创造了每个翼鸟，各从其类。而上帝见它是善的。

% Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
\N 于是上帝祝福它们并说，“要富有果实、倍增并充满海洋的诸水，并让鸟类在地上倍增。”

% And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
\N 然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第五日。

\subsubsection*{第六日}

% And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
\N 而上帝说，“让大地生出生灵各从其类：牲畜、陆地爬行动物以及地上的走兽，各从其类。”而它就如此。
% God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\N 上帝制造地上的走兽各从其类，牲畜各从其类，以及在地上爬行的一切各从其类。而上帝见它是善的。

% Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself and every creature that crawls upon it.”
\N 然后上帝说：“让我们依我们的形象，照我们的样子制造人，以统治海里的鱼和空中的鸟，统治牲畜，并统治全地本身以及每个在其上爬行的生物。”

% So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
\N 所以上帝照祂自身的形象创造了人，依上帝的形象祂创造了他；祂创造了他们，男性和女性。

% God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.”
\N 上帝祝福他们并对他们说：“要富有果实并倍增，而充满大地并制伏它；统治海里的鱼、空中的鸟、以及在地上爬行的每个生物。”

% Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food.
\N 然后上帝说，“看啊，我已赐给你在全地表上的结种子的每个植物，和包含种子果实的每颗树。它们将成为你们的食物。
% And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
\N 而对地上每个走兽和空中每只鸟以及每个在地上爬行的生物---一切其中有生命气息的---我已将每个绿植赐为食物。”而它就如此。

% And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
\N 而上帝看向祂已制造的所有，而的确，它是甚善的。

然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第六日。

% Genesis 2
\section{第二章}

% The Seventh Day
\subsection*{第七日}

% Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
\N 因此诸天和地被完备在所有它们浩瀚的阵列中。
% And by the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work.
\N 而到第七日，上帝已结束祂已在做的工作；因此，在第七日，祂从祂所有的工作中安息了。

% Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished.
\N 于是上帝祝福第七日并使它圣洁，因为在那天，祂从祂已成就的所有创造之工中安息了。

% Man and Woman in the Garden
\subsection*{园子中的男人和女人}

% This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.
\N 这是诸天和地在它们被造时，在耶和华上帝制造它们的那日的记述。

% Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted, for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
\N 现在田野的灌木未曾在地上显现，田野的植物也还未曾发芽，因为耶和华上帝未曾送雨到地上，也没有人耕种地面，
% But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
\N 但泉水从大地涌出并浇灌地面的整个表面。

% Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
\N 然后耶和华上帝从地面的尘土中塑造了一个人并将生命的气息吐息进他的鼻孔，那人就成为了一个生命体。

% And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed.
\N 而耶和华上帝在东方的伊甸中培植了一个园子，祂将祂已塑造的那人安置在那里。
% Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\N 耶和华上帝使每颗树长出地面---那些悦目而宜为食物的树。而在园子的中央是生命树和分辨善恶的树。

% Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters:
\N 现在一条浇灌园子的河从伊甸流出，而从那里它分支成四个水源：

% The name of the first river is the Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
\N 第一条河的名字是比逊；它蜿蜒穿过哈腓拉整个陆地，而那里有金子。
% And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there.
\N 而那陆地的金子是纯的，芳香树脂和玛瑙也在那里被发现。

% The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush.
\N 第二条河的名字是基训；它蜿蜒穿过古实整个陆地。

% The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
\N 第三条河的名字是底格里斯；它沿着亚述的东侧流淌。而第四条河是幼发拉底。

% Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
\N 然后耶和华上帝带了那人并将他安置在伊甸园中以耕种并看护它。

% And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden,
\N 而耶和华上帝命令他，“你可以自由地以园子的每一颗树为食，
% but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
\N 但你决不能以分辨善恶树为食；因为在你吃它的那日，你肯定会死。”

% The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”
\N 耶和华上帝还说，“孤独对那人不好。我会为他造一个合适的帮手。”

% And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
\N 而耶和华上帝以土壤塑造了田野中每一只走兽和空中每一只鸟，而祂将它们带给那人而看他会给各个取什么名。而无论那人称呼各个生灵什么，那就是它的名字。
% The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adame no suitable helper was found.
\N 那人将名字给所有牲畜、空中的鸟类，并给田野的每个走兽。但对亚当没有适合的帮手被找到。

% So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the area with flesh. 
\N 所以耶和华上帝令那人陷入沉睡，而在他睡着时，祂取了那人的一根肋骨并以肉将那地方闭合。
% And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him.
\N 而从那耶和华上帝从那人取来的肋骨，祂制造了一个女人并将她带给他。
% And the man said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for out of man she was taken.”
\N 而那人说：

“这正是我的骨中骨和我的肉中肉；她应该被称为‘女人，’因为她取自于男人。”

% For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
\N 因此，一个男人会离开他的父亲和母亲并与他的妻子联合，而他们就会成为一体。

% And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.
\N 而那男人和他的妻子俩都是裸露的，他们却不觉羞愧。

% Genesis 3
\section{第三章}

% The Serpent’s Deception
\subsection*{大蛇的欺骗}

% Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden?’”
\N 现在那大蛇比耶和华上帝已造的田野的任何走兽都狡黠。而他对那女人说，“上帝真的说，‘你决不能以园子中的任何树为食？’”

% The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden,
\N 那女人回答那大蛇，“我们可以吃园子中树的果实，
% but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’”
\N 但对于在园子中央的树的果实，上帝已说，‘你决不能吃它或摸它，否则你会死。’”

% “You will not surely die,” the serpent told the woman. 
\N “你不一定会死，”那大蛇告诉那女人。
% “For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
\N “因为上帝知道在你吃它的那日，你的双眼会被打开而你会像上帝一样，知道善与恶。”

% When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
\N 当那女人看见那树宜为食物且悦目，而它是为获得智慧所渴望的，她就取了果实并吃了它。她也将一些给了与她一同的丈夫，而他也吃了它。

% And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves.
\N 他们俩的眼睛就都被打开了，而他们知道了他们是裸露的；所以他们把无花果叶缝在一起，而为他们自己做遮盖。

% God Arraigns Adam and Eve
\subsection*{上帝提讯亚当和夏娃}

% Then the man and his wife heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.

\N 然后在那日风凉时，那人和他的妻子听见耶和华上帝在园子里行走的声音，他们就在园子的树丛中向耶和华上帝的临在隐藏。

% But the LORD God called out to the man, “Where are you?”
\N 但耶和华上帝向那人呼唤：“你在哪里？”

% “I heard Your voice in the garden,” he replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
\N 他回应：“我在园子里听见了祢的声音，而我害怕因为我是裸露的；所以我躲藏了我自己。”

% “Who told you that you were naked?” asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
\N 而耶和华上帝问：“谁告诉你你是裸露的？难道你已以我命令了你不要吃的树为食吗？”

% And the man answered, “The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
\N 而那人回答，“祢赐给我的那女人，她将果实从那树上给我，而我吃了它。”

% Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”
\N 于是耶和华上帝对那女人说，“你已做的这是什么？”

% “The serpent deceived me,” she replied, “and I ate.”
她回应，“那大蛇欺骗了我，我就吃了。”

% The Fate of the Serpent
\subsection*{大蛇的定命}
% So the LORD God said to the serpent:
\N 所以耶和华上帝对那大蛇说：

% “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field! On your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all the days of your life.
“因为你已做此，你所受咒诅在田野所有牲畜和每个走兽之上！在你生命的所有日子，你会用腹部爬行，而你会吃尘土。

% And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.
\N 而我会在你和那女人之间，并在你的苗裔和她的苗裔之间结仇。

% He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”
他会击碎你的头，而你会打伤他的脚跟。”

% The Punishment of Mankind
\subsection*{人类的惩罚}

% To the woman He said:
\N 对那女人祂说：

% “I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth; in pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”
“我会急剧增加你在分娩时的痛苦；你会在痛苦中生出儿女。你会渴望得到你的丈夫，而他会管治你。”

% And to Adam He said:
\N 而对亚当祂说：

% “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you; through toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
“因为你已听从你妻子的话音并已以我命令了你不要吃的树为食，地面因你受咒诅；在你生命的所有日子，借着劳苦你才会从它有吃的。

% Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
\N 它会为你结出荆棘和刺蓟，而你会吃田野的植物。

% By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread, until you return to the ground—because out of it were you taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.”
\N 你将由眉头的汗水吃食，直到你回归地面---因为你被取自于它。而你是尘土，也将回归尘土。”

% And Adam named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all the living.
\N 而亚当给他妻子取名夏娃，因为她会是众生之母。

% The Expulsion from Paradise
\subsection*{逐出乐园}

% And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.
\N 而耶和华上帝为亚当和他的妻子造了兽皮的服装，并且祂为他们穿戴。

% Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”
\N 然后耶和华上帝说，“看那，那人已成为像我们其中一个一样知道善恶。而现在，以免他伸出他的手，也从那生命树摘取并吃，就永远活着\dots”

% Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. 
\N 因此耶和华上帝将他从伊甸园流放，去劳作他被取自的地面。
% So He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life.
\N 所以祂驱走那人并在伊甸园的东侧派驻基路伯，连同旋转的火焰之剑来守卫到生命树的道路。

% Genesis 4
\section{第四章}

% Cain and Abel
\subsection*{该隐和亚伯}

% And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain.
\N 而亚当与他的妻子夏娃同房，她就受孕而诞生出该隐。

% “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said.
“靠耶和华的帮助我生出一个男人，”她说。

% Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel.
\N 后来她诞生出该隐的兄弟亚伯。

% Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil.
现在亚伯是个守护绵羊的，而该隐是个耕种土地的。
% So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD,
\N 所以一段时间后，该隐将土地的一些果实作为供品带给耶和华，
% while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock.
\N 而亚伯带了他羊群中头生的最好的部分。

% And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供品，
% but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.
\N 但祂不顾及该隐和他的供品。所以该隐变得非常愤怒，而他的脸低垂着。

% “Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen?
\N “你为什么愤怒，”耶和华对该隐说，“而为什么你的脸已低垂呢？
% If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.”
\N 如果你做正确的事，你会不被接受吗？但如果你拒绝做正确的事，罪恶就伏在你的门口；它渴望你，但你必须掌控它。”

% Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
\N 然后该隐对他的兄弟亚伯说，“让我们外出到野地去。”而当他们在野地里时，该隐奋起攻击他的兄弟亚伯并杀了他。

% And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”
\N 而耶和华对该隐说，“你的兄弟亚伯在哪里？”

% “I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
“我不知道！”他回答，“难道我是我兄弟的守护者吗？”

% “What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.
\N “你已做了什么？”耶和华回应。“你兄弟的血的话音从地面向我哭嚎。
% Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
\N 现在你被咒诅并从地面流放，因为它已张开它的口从你手中接收你兄弟的血。
% When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
\N 当你耕作地面时，它不再会为你结出它的产出。你会在地上成为一个逃亡者和一个流浪者。”
