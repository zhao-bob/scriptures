% Genesis 1
\section{第一章}

% The Creation

\subsection*{创世}

% In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\N 起初上帝创造诸天和地。
% Now the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\N 现在地是混沌空虚的，黑暗在深渊的表面之上，而上帝的圣灵在诸水上盘旋着。

\subsubsection*{第一日}

% And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.
\N 而上帝说，“让那有光”，就有了光。
% God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.
\N 上帝见那光是善的，祂就将光从黑暗分离。
% God called the light “day,” and the darkness He called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
\N 上帝称那光为“白昼”，而那黑暗祂称为“黑夜。”

然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第一日。

\subsubsection*{第二日}

% And God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, to separate the waters from the waters.”
\N 而上帝说，“让那诸水之间有穹苍将水和水分离。”
% So God made the expanse and separated the waters beneath it from the waters above. And it was so.
\N 所以上帝制造那穹苍并将它之下的诸水与之上的诸水分离。而它就如此。
% God called the expanse “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
\N 上帝称穹苍为“天空。”

然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第二日。

\subsubsection*{第三日}

% And God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered into one place, so that the dry land may appear.” And it was so.
\N 而上帝说，“让天空之下的诸水被聚集到一个地方，以使旱地能显现。”而它就如此。
% God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of waters He called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.
\N 上帝称那旱地为“大地”，而诸水聚集处祂称为“海洋。”而上帝见它是善的。

% Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each bearing fruit with seed according to its kind.” And it was so.
\N 然后上帝说，“让大地生出植被：结种子的植物和结带种子果实的果树，各按其类。”而它就如此。
% The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
\N 大地产出植被：结种子的植物各从其类，而结带种子的果实的树各从其类。而上帝见它是善的。

% And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.
\N 然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第三日。

\subsubsection*{第四日}
% And God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to distinguish between the day and the night, and let them be signs to mark the seasons and days and years.
\N 而上帝说，“让那有光体在天空的穹苍中，以在白昼和黑夜之间作区别，并让它们成为标明季节、日子、年岁的记号。
% And let them serve as lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth.” And it was so.
\N 并让它们在天空的穹苍中充当光体，以照耀在大地之上。”而它就如此。

% God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night. And He made the stars as well.
\N 上帝制造了两个巨大的光体：较大的光体统管白昼而较小的光体统管黑夜。而祂也制造了星辰。

% God set these lights in the expanse of the sky to shine upon the earth,
\N 上帝将这些光体设置在天空的穹苍中，照耀在大地之上，
% to preside over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
\N 掌管白昼和黑夜，并将光从黑暗分离。而上帝见它是善的。

% And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.
\N 然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第四日。

\subsubsection*{第五日}

% And God said, “Let the waters teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of the sky.”
\N 而上帝说，“让诸水以生灵充盈，并让雀鸟飞翔大地之上在天空开阔的穹苍中。”
% So God created the great sea creatures and every living thing that moves, with which the waters teemed according to their kinds, and every winged bird after its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\N 所以上帝创造了巨大的海洋生物和每个活动的活物，诸水以它们充盈各从其类，并创造了每个翼鸟，各从其类。而上帝见它是善的。

% Then God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters of the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.”
\N 于是上帝祝福它们并说，“要富有果实、倍增并充满海洋的诸水，并让雀鸟在地上倍增。”

% And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.
\N 然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第五日。

\subsubsection*{第六日}

% And God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, land crawlers, and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so.
\N 而上帝说，“让大地生出生灵各从其类：牲畜、陆地爬行动物以及地上的走兽，各从其类。”而它就如此。
% God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that crawls upon the earth according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
\N 上帝制造地上的走兽各从其类，牲畜各从其类，以及在地上爬行的一切各从其类。而上帝见它是善的。

% Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, to rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air, over the livestock, and over all the earth itself and every creature that crawls upon it.”
\N 然后上帝说：“让我们依我们的形象，照我们的样子制造人，以统治海里的鱼和空中的鸟，统治牲畜，并统治全地本身以及每个在其上爬行的生物。”

% So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
\N 所以上帝照祂自身的形象创造了人，依上帝的形象祂创造了他；祂创造了他们，男性和女性。

% God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth.”
\N 上帝祝福他们并对他们说：“要富有果实并倍增，而充满大地并制伏它；统治海里的鱼、空中的鸟、以及在地上爬行的每个生物。”

% Then God said, “Behold, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit contains seed. They will be yours for food.
\N 然后上帝说，“看啊，我已赐给你在全地表上的结种子的每个植物，和包含种子果实的每颗树。它们将成为你们的食物。
% And to every beast of the earth and every bird of the air and every creature that crawls upon the earth—everything that has the breath of life in it—I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so.
\N 而对地上每个走兽和空中每只鸟以及每个在地上爬行的生物---一切其中有生命气息的---我已将每个绿植赐为食物。”而它就如此。

% And God looked upon all that He had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.
\N 而上帝看向祂已制造的所有，而的确，它是甚善的。

然后有夜晚，又有早晨---这是第六日。

% Genesis 2
\section{第二章}

% The Seventh Day
\subsection*{第七日}

% Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.
\N 因此诸天和地被完备在所有它们浩瀚的阵列中。
% And by the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work.
\N 而到第七日，上帝已结束祂已在做的工作；因此，在第七日，祂从祂所有的工作中安息了。

% Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished.
\N 于是上帝祝福第七日并使它圣洁，因为在那天，祂从祂已成就的所有创造之工中安息了。

% Man and Woman in the Garden
\subsection*{园子中的男人和女人}

% This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.
\N 这是诸天和地在它们被造时，在耶和华上帝制造它们的那日的记述。

% Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted, for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.
\N 现在田野的灌木未曾在地上显现，田野的植物也还未曾发芽，因为耶和华上帝未曾送雨到地上，也没有人耕种地面，
% But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.
\N 但泉水从大地涌出并浇灌地面的整个表面。

% Then the LORD God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.
\N 然后耶和华上帝从地面的尘土中塑造了一个人并将生命气息吐息进他的鼻孔，那人就成为了一个生命体。

% And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed.
\N 而耶和华上帝在东方的伊甸中培植了一个园子，祂将祂已塑造的那人安置在那里。
% Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
\N 耶和华上帝使每颗树长出地面---那些悦目而宜为食物的树。而在园子的中央是生命树和分辨善恶的树。

% Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters:
\N 现在一条浇灌园子的河从伊甸流出，而从那里它分支成四个水源：

% The name of the first river is the Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
\N 第一条河的名字是比逊；它蜿蜒穿过哈腓拉整个陆地，而那里有金子。
% And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there.
\N 而那陆地的金子是纯的，芳香树脂和玛瑙也在那里被发现。

% The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush.
\N 第二条河的名字是基训；它蜿蜒穿过古实整个陆地。

% The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
\N 第三条河的名字是底格里斯；它沿着亚述的东侧流淌。而第四条河是幼发拉底。

% Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.
\N 然后耶和华上帝带了那人并将他安置在伊甸园中以耕种并看护它。

% And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden,
\N 而耶和华上帝命令他，“你可以自由地以园子的每一颗树为食，
% but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”
\N 但你决不能以分辨善恶树为食；因为在你吃它的那日，你肯定会死。”

% The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”
\N 耶和华上帝还说，“孤独对那人不好。我会为他造一个合适的帮手。”

% And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.
\N 而耶和华上帝以土壤塑造了田野中每一只走兽和空中每一只鸟，而祂将它们带给那人而看他会给各个取什么名。而无论那人称呼各个生灵什么，那就是它的名字。
% The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adame no suitable helper was found.
\N 那人将名字给所有牲畜、空中的雀鸟，并给田野的每个走兽。但对亚当没有适合的帮手被找到。

% So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the area with flesh. 
\N 所以耶和华上帝令那人陷入沉睡，而在他睡着时，祂取了那人的一根肋骨并以肉将那地方闭合。
% And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him.
\N 而从那耶和华上帝从那人取来的肋骨，祂制造了一个女人并将她带给他。
% And the man said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for out of man she was taken.”
\N 而那人说：

“这正是我的骨中骨和我的肉中肉；她应该被称为‘女人，’因为她取自于男人。”

% For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
\N 因此，一个男人会离开他的父亲和母亲并与他的妻子联合，而他们就会成为一体。

% And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.
\N 而那男人和他的妻子俩都是裸露的，他们却不觉羞愧。

% Genesis 3
\section{第三章}

% The Serpent’s Deception
\subsection*{大蛇的欺骗}

% Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field that the LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree in the garden?’”
\N 现在那大蛇比耶和华上帝已造的田野的任何走兽都狡黠。而他对那女人说，“上帝真的说，‘你决不能以园子中的任何树为食？’”

% The woman answered the serpent, “We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden,
\N 那女人回答那大蛇，“我们可以吃园子中树的果实，
% but about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You must not eat of it or touch it, or you will die.’”
\N 但对于在园子中央的树的果实，上帝已说，‘你决不能吃它或摸它，否则你会死。’”

% “You will not surely die,” the serpent told the woman. 
\N “你不一定会死，”那大蛇告诉那女人。
% “For God knows that in the day you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.”
\N “因为上帝知道在你吃它的那日，你的双眼会被打开而你会像上帝一样，知道善与恶。”

% When the woman saw that the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eyes, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom, she took the fruit and ate it. She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
\N 当那女人看见那树宜为食物且悦目，而它是为获得智慧所渴望的，她就取了果实并吃了它。她也将一些给了与她一同的丈夫，而他也吃了它。

% And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed together fig leaves and made coverings for themselves.
\N 他们俩的眼睛就都被打开了，而他们知道了他们是裸露的；所以他们把无花果叶缝在一起，而为他们自己做遮盖。

% God Arraigns Adam and Eve
\subsection*{上帝提讯亚当和夏娃}

% Then the man and his wife heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, and they hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.

\N 然后在那日风凉时，那人和他的妻子听见耶和华上帝在园子里行走的声音，他们就在园子的树丛中向耶和华上帝的临在隐藏。

% But the LORD God called out to the man, “Where are you?”
\N 但耶和华上帝向那人呼唤：“你在哪里？”

% “I heard Your voice in the garden,” he replied, “and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.”
\N 他回应：“我在园子里听见了祢的声音，而我害怕因为我是裸露的；所以我躲藏了我自己。”

% “Who told you that you were naked?” asked the LORD God. “Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?”
\N 而耶和华上帝问：“谁告诉你你是裸露的？难道你已以我命令了你不要吃的树为食吗？”

% And the man answered, “The woman whom You gave me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate it.”
\N 而那人回答，“祢赐给我的那女人，她将果实从那树上给我，而我吃了它。”

% Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this you have done?”
\N 于是耶和华上帝对那女人说，“你已做的这是什么？”

% “The serpent deceived me,” she replied, “and I ate.”
她回应，“那大蛇欺骗了我，我就吃了。”

% The Fate of the Serpent
\subsection*{大蛇的定命}
% So the LORD God said to the serpent:
\N 所以耶和华上帝对那大蛇说：

% “Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and every beast of the field! On your belly will you go, and dust you will eat, all the days of your life.
“因为你已做此，你所受咒诅在田野所有牲畜和每个走兽之上！在你生命的所有日子，你会用腹部爬行，而你会吃尘土。

% And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed.
\N 而我会在你和那女人之间，并在你的苗裔和她的苗裔之间结仇。

% He will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.”
他会击碎你的头，而你会击打他的脚跟。”

% The Punishment of Mankind
\subsection*{人类的惩罚}

% To the woman He said:
\N 对那女人祂说：

% “I will sharply increase your pain in childbirth; in pain you will bring forth children. Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you.”
“我会急剧增加你在分娩时的痛苦；你会在痛苦中生出儿女。你会渴望得到你的丈夫，而他会管治你。”

% And to Adam He said:
\N 而对亚当祂说：

% “Because you have listened to the voice of your wife and have eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, cursed is the ground because of you; through toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.
“因为你已听从你妻子的话音并已以我命令了你不要吃的树为食，地面因你受咒诅；在你生命的所有日子，借着艰苦你才会从它有吃的。

% Both thorns and thistles it will yield for you, and you will eat the plants of the field.
\N 它会为你结出荆棘和刺蓟，而你会吃田野的植物。

% By the sweat of your brow you will eat your bread, until you return to the ground—because out of it were you taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return.”
\N 你将由眉头的汗水吃食，直到你回归地面---因为你被取自于它。而你是尘土，也将回归尘土。”

% And Adam named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all the living.
\N 而亚当给他妻子取名夏娃，因为她会是众生之母。

% The Expulsion from Paradise
\subsection*{逐出乐园}

% And the LORD God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife, and He clothed them.
\N 而耶和华上帝为亚当和他的妻子造了兽皮的衣裳，并且祂为他们穿戴。

% Then the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever...”
\N 然后耶和华上帝说，“看那，那人已成为像我们其中一个一样知道善恶。而现在，以免他伸出他的手，也从那生命树摘取并吃，就永远活着\dots”

% Therefore the LORD God banished him from the Garden of Eden to work the ground from which he had been taken. 
\N 因此耶和华上帝将他从伊甸园流放，去劳作他被取自的地面。
% So He drove out the man and stationed cherubim on the east side of the Garden of Eden, along with a whirling sword of flame to guard the way to the tree of life.
\N 所以祂驱走那人并在伊甸园的东侧派驻基路伯，连同旋转的火焰之剑来守卫到生命树的道路。

% Genesis 4
\section{第四章}

% Cain and Abel
\subsection*{该隐和亚伯}

% And Adam had relations with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain.
\N 而亚当与他的妻子夏娃同房，她就受孕而生下该隐。

% “With the help of the LORD I have brought forth a man,” she said.
“靠耶和华的帮助我生出一个男人，”她说。

% Later she gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel.
\N 后来她生下该隐的兄弟亚伯。

% Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, while Cain was a tiller of the soil.
现在亚伯是个守护绵羊的，而该隐是个耕种田地的。
% So in the course of time, Cain brought some of the fruit of the soil as an offering to the LORD,
\N 所以一段时间后，该隐将田地的一些果实作为供品带给耶和华，
% while Abel brought the best portions of the firstborn of his flock.
\N 而亚伯带了他羊群中头生的最好的部分。

% And the LORD looked with favor on Abel and his offering,
耶和华看中了亚伯和他的供品，
% but He had no regard for Cain and his offering. So Cain became very angry, and his countenance fell.
\N 但祂不顾及该隐和他的供品。所以该隐变得非常愤怒，而他的脸低垂着。

% “Why are you angry,” said the LORD to Cain, “and why has your countenance fallen?
\N “你为什么愤怒，”耶和华对该隐说，“而为什么你的脸已低垂呢？
% If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you refuse to do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires you, but you must master it.”
\N 如果你做正确的事，你会不被接受吗？但如果你拒绝做正确的事，罪恶就伏在你的门口；它渴望你，但你必须掌控它。”

% Then Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let us go out to the field.” And while they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel and killed him.
\N 然后该隐对他的兄弟亚伯说，“让我们外出到野外去。”而当他们在野外时，该隐奋起攻击他的兄弟亚伯并杀了他。

% And the LORD said to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?”
\N 而耶和华对该隐说，“你的兄弟亚伯在哪里？”

% “I do not know!” he answered. “Am I my brother’s keeper?”
“我不知道！”他回答，“难道我是我兄弟的守护者吗？”

% “What have you done?” replied the LORD. “The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground.
\N “你已做了什么？”耶和华回应。“你兄弟的血的话音从地面向我哭嚎。
% Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
\N 现在你被咒诅并从地面流放，因为它已张开它的口从你手中接收你兄弟的血。
% When you till the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
\N 当你耕作地面时，它不再会为你结出它的产出。你会在地上成为一个逃亡者和一个流浪者。”

% But Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 
\N 但该隐对耶和华说，“我的惩罚大过我能承受的。
% Behold, this day You have driven me from the face of the earth, and from Your face I will be hidden; I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.”
\N 看那，今日祢已将我从地表驱走，而我会从祢的面隐藏；我你会在地上成为一个逃亡者和一个流浪者，而无论谁找到我都会杀我。”

% “Not so!” replied the LORD. “If anyone slays Cain, then Cain will be avenged sevenfold.” And the LORD placed a mark on Cain, so that no one who found him would kill him.
\N “并非如此！”耶和华回应。“如果任何人残杀该隐，那么该隐会得七重复仇。”而耶和华将一个标记放置在该隐上，使得找到他的无人会杀他。

% So Cain went out from the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
\N 所以该隐从耶和华的临在走出，而在伊甸之东、挪得之地
    \footnote {
		\textit{挪得}意思是\textit{流浪}。
	}
居住。

% The Descendants of Cain
\subsection*{该隐的后代}

% And Cain had relations with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son Enoch.
\N 而该隐和他的妻子同房，她就受孕而生下以诺。然后该隐建造了一座城市并以他儿子以诺为它取名。

% Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methusael, and Methusael was the father of Lamech.
\N 现在为以诺出生了以拿，而以拿是米户雅利的父亲，而米户雅利是玛土撒利的父亲，而玛土撒利是拉麦的父亲。
% And Lamech married two women, one named Adah and the other Zillah.
\N 而拉麦娶了两个女人，一个名叫亚大而另一个叫洗拉。

% Adah gave birth to Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and raise livestock.
\N 亚大生下雅八；他是那些栖居在帐篷中、饲养牲畜的人之父。
% And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all who play the harp and flute.
\N 而他兄弟的名字是犹八；他是所有演奏琴笛的人之父。

% And Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, a forger of every implement of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
\N 而洗拉生下土八该隐，一个每件铜铁用具的锻造者。而土八该隐的姊妹是拿玛。

% Then Lamech said to his wives:
\N 然后拉麦对他的妻子们说：

% “Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; wives of Lamech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
“亚大和洗拉，听见我的话音；拉麦的妻子，听从我的话语。而因为使我负伤，我已残杀一个男人，而因为击打我，我残杀了一个年轻人。
% If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.”
\N 如果该隐得七重复仇，那么拉麦得七十七重。”

% Seth and Enosh
\subsection*{塞特和以挪士}

% And Adam again had relations with his wife, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, saying, “God has granted me another seed in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”
\N 而亚当再次与他的妻子同房，她就生下一个儿子并给他取名塞特，说，“上帝已准予我另一个苗裔代替亚伯，因为该隐杀了他。”

% And to Seth also a son was born, and he called him Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the LORD.
\N 而为塞特也出生了一个儿子，而他称他以挪士。

在那时人们开始求靠耶和华的名。

% Genesis 5
\section{第五章}

% The Descendants of Adam
\subsection*{亚当的后代}

% This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, He made him in His own likeness.
\N 这是亚当世代的族谱。在上帝创造人的那日，祂依祂自身的样子制造了他。
% Male and female He created them, and He blessed them. And in the day they were created, He called them “man.”
\N 祂创造了他们，男性和女性，而祂祝福他们。而在他们被创造的那日，祂称他们为“人。”

% Now the whole world had one language and a common form of speech.

% And as people journeyed eastward, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.
\N 而当族民向东旅行时，他们在示拿之地发现一块平原并在那里安家。

% And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them thoroughly.” So they used brick instead of stone, and tar instead of mortar.
\N 而他们对彼此说，“来，让我们造砖并将它们彻底烧硬。”所以他们使用砖替代石头，并用柏油替代灰泥。

% “Come,” they said, “let us build for ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of all the earth.”
\N “来，”他们说，“让我们为我们自己建造一座城，有一座塔到达诸天，以使我们能为我们自己立一个名字而不被分散到全地表上。”

% Then the LORD came down to see the city and the tower that the sons of men were building.
\N 然后耶和华降临来看察这城和人类子嗣们在建造的塔。
% And the LORD said, “If they have begun to do this as one people speaking the same language, then nothing they devise will be beyond them.
\N 而耶和华说，“假使他们作为讲相同语言的一族开始做这，那么他们策划的就没有什么会对他们不可能了。
% Come, let Us go down and confuse their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.”
\N 来，让我们降下并使他们的语言混乱，以使他们会不理解彼此的口语。”

% So the LORD scattered them from there over the face of all the earth, and they stopped building the city.
\N 所以耶和华将他们从那里分散到全地表上，而他们停止了建造那城。
% That is why it is called Babel, for there the LORD confused the language of the whole world, and from that place the LORD scattered them over the face of all the earth.

\N 但亚伯兰回复，“主上帝啊，祢能赐给我什么，既然我依旧无子，那我家族继承人是大马色的以利以谢吗？”
% Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.”
\N 亚伯兰继续，“看啊，祢尚未赐给我任何后嗣，所以我家室中的一位仆人将是我的继承人。”

% Then the word of the LORD came to Abram, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”
\N 于是耶和华的言临到亚伯兰，说，“这一个不是你的继承人，而来自你自身身体的一个会是你的继承人。”
% And the LORD took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.”
\N 而耶和华带他到外面并说，“现在看向诸天，如果你有能力，就数算星辰。”然后祂告诉他，“你的后嗣也必如此。”

% Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
\N 亚伯兰相信耶和华，而这作为义被归功于他。

% The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”
\N 耶和华也告诉他，“我是耶和华，我将你带出迦勒底的吾珥以将此地赐给你占有。”

% God Confirms His Promise
\subsection*{上帝确认祂的应许}

% But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?”
\N 但亚伯兰回复，“主上帝，我如何能知道我会占有它？”

% And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.”
\N 而耶和华对他说，“给我带一只母牛、一只母山羊，和一只公绵羊，各只都三岁大，连同一只斑鸠和一只雏鸽。”

% So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half.
\N 所以亚伯兰将所有这些带给祂，将它们各个都从中间劈开，并将两半相互对着摆放。然而，他没有将雀鸟切成两半。
% And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
\N 而捕食的雀鸟降落在尸体上，但亚伯兰赶走了他们。
% As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him.
\N 当太阳要下山时，亚伯兰陷入沉睡，而突然巨大的恐惧和黑暗淹没了他。

% Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.
\N 然后耶和华对亚伯兰说，“要确定知道你的后代会在一个不是他们自身的土地上成为寄居者，而他们会被奴役并被虐待四百年。
% But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions.
\N 但我会审判他们作奴隶服侍的族民，而之后他们会带着许多财产离去。
% You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.
\N 然而，你会和平地去到你先祖那里并在高寿时被埋葬。
% In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”
\N 在第四代你的后代会返回这里，因为亚摩利人的罪邪还未满盈。”

% When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses.
\N 当太阳已落山而黑暗已降下时，看啊，一个冒烟的火盆和一个冒火的火把出现并在对半的尸体之间经过。
% On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—
\N 在那日耶和华与亚伯兰立了一个圣约，说，“我已将这地赐给你的后代---从埃及河到幼发拉底大河---

% Hagar and Ishmael
\subsection*{夏甲与以实玛利}

% Now Abram’s wife Sarai had borne him no children, but she had an Egyptian maidservant named Hagar.
\N 现在亚伯兰的妻子撒莱未为他生孩子，但她有一个埃及女仆名叫夏甲。
% So Sarai said to Abram, “Look now, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. Please go to my maidservant; perhaps I can build a family by her.”
\N 所以撒莱对亚伯兰说，“现在看，耶和华已阻止我生孩子。请去到我女仆那；也许我能由她建立一个家庭。”

% And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
而亚伯兰听从了撒莱的话。
% So after he had lived in Canaan for ten years, his wife Sarai took her Egyptian maidservant Hagar and gave her to Abram to be his wife.
\N 所以在他已在迦南生活十年之后，他的妻子撒莱带了她的埃及女仆夏甲并将她给了亚伯兰作他的妻子。
% And he slept with Hagar, and she conceived. But when Hagar realized that she was pregnant, she began to despise her mistress.
\N 而他与夏甲同寝，她就受孕了。但当夏甲意识到她怀孕时，她开始鄙视她的女主。

% Then Sarai said to Abram, “May the wrong done to me be upon you! I delivered my servant into your arms, and ever since she saw that she was pregnant, she has treated me with contempt. May the LORD judge between you and me.”
\N 于是撒莱对亚伯兰说，“愿对我做的错加在你身上！我将我的仆人交到你的怀中，而自打她看见她怀孕以来，她就已以藐视对待我。愿耶和华在你我之间评判。”

% “Here,” said Abram, “your servant is in your hands. Do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she fled from her.
\N “在这，”亚伯兰说，“你的仆人在你的手中。随你对她做什么。”然后撒莱如此严酷地对待夏甲以至于她从她逃走。

% Now the angel of the LORD found Hagar by a spring of water in the desert—the spring along the road to Shur.
\N 现在耶和华的使者在沙漠的水泉边发现了夏甲---那泉水沿着路通往书珥。
% “Hagar, servant of Sarai,” he said, “where have you come from, and where are you going?”
\N “夏甲，撒莱的仆人，”他说，“你从哪里来，而要往哪里去？”

% “I am running away from my mistress Sarai,” she replied.
“我正逃离我的女主撒莱，”她回复。

% So the angel of the LORD told her, “Return to your mistress and submit to her authority.” 
\N 所以耶和华的使者告诉她，“返回到你女主那里并服从她的权威。”
% Then the angel added, “I will greatly multiply your offspring so that they will be too numerous to count.”
\N 然后使者补充说，“我会大大倍增你的后嗣以致他们会不可胜数。”

% The angel of the LORD proceeded: “Behold, you have conceived and will bear a son. And you shall name him Ishmael, for the LORD has heard your cry of affliction.
\N 耶和华的使者接着说：“看啊，你已受孕并会生一个儿子。而你必给他取名以实玛利，因为耶和华已听见你痛苦的哭喊。

% He will be a wild donkey of a man, and his hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand against him;
\N 他会成为一个野驴般的人，而他的手会对抗每个人，而每个人的手会对抗他；

% he will live in hostility toward all his brothers.”
他会活在对他所有兄弟的敌意中。”

% So Hagar gave this name to the LORD who had spoken to her: “You are the God who sees me,” for she said, “Here I have seen the One who sees me!”
\N 所以夏甲将这个名字给已对她讲话的耶和华：“祢是看见我的上帝，”因为她说，“在这里我已看见那看见我的独一位！”
% Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi. It is located between Kadesh and Bered.
\N 因此那井被称为庇耳拉海莱。它位于加低斯和巴列之间。

% And Hagar bore Abram a son, and Abram gave the name Ishmael to the son she had borne.
\N 而夏甲为亚伯兰生了一个儿子，而亚伯兰将名字以实玛利给了她生的这个儿子。
% Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
\N 当夏甲为他生以实玛利时，亚伯兰八十六岁。

% Whether they are born in your household or purchased, they must be circumcised. My covenant in your flesh will be an everlasting covenant.
\N 不管他们在你家室出生或是购买的，他们必须受割礼。我的圣约在你肉体中会是一个永久之约。

% But if any male is not circumcised, he will be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”
\N 但如果任何男性不受割礼，他会从他的族民中被剪除；他已破坏我的圣约。”

% Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, do not call her Sarai, for her name is to be Sarah.
\N 然后上帝对亚伯拉罕说，“至于撒莱你的妻子，不要称她撒莱，因为她的名字要是撒拉。
% And I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her, and she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will descend from her.”
\N 而我会祝福她并无疑会由她赐给你一个儿子。我会祝福她，而她会成为众邦之母；万族的众王会从她衍生。”

% Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed and said to himself, “Can a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth at the age of ninety?”
\N 亚伯拉罕俯伏在地。然后他笑了并对他自己说，“能为一个一百岁的人生出一个孩子？撒拉能在九十的年纪生子？”
% And Abraham said to God, “O that Ishmael might live under Your blessing!”
\N 而亚伯拉罕对上帝说，“但愿以实玛利活在祢的祝福下！”

% But God replied, “Your wife Sarah will indeed bear you a son, and you are to name him Isaac. I will establish My covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him.
\N 但上帝回复，“你的妻子撒拉的确会为你生一个儿子，而你要给他取名以撒。我会与他确立我的圣约，作为他之后他的后代的一个永久之约。
% As for Ishmael, I have heard you, and I will surely bless him; I will make him fruitful and multiply him greatly. He will become the father of twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation. 
\N 至于以实玛利，我已听见你，而我无疑会祝福他；我会使他富有果实而使他大大倍增。他会成为十二个统治者的父亲，而我会使他成为一个伟大的邦族。

% “My lord,” said Abraham, “if I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass your servant by.
\N “我主，”亚伯拉罕说，“若我已在你视域中得青睐，请不要路过你的仆人。
% Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree.
\N 让我带一点水，以使你能清洗你们的脚并在树下歇息一下。
% And I will bring a bit of bread so that you may refresh yourselves. This is why you have passed your servant’s way. After that, you may continue on your way.”
\N 而我会带一点饼以使你能恢复一下精力。这是为何你经过你仆人的道路。在那之后，你能继续上路。”

% “Yes,” they replied, “you may do as you have said.”

% So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Prepare three seahs of fine flour, knead it, and bake some bread.”
\N 所以亚伯拉罕赶快进入帐篷并对撒拉说，“快点！预备三细亚精制面粉，揉面，并烤一些饼。”

% Meanwhile, Abraham ran to the herd, selected a tender and choice calf, and gave it to a servant, who hurried to prepare it.
\N 同时，亚伯拉罕跑向牛群，挑选一头细嫩而上好的牛犊，并将它给仆人，仆人赶快将它预备。

% For I have chosen him, so that he will command his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just, in order that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has promised.”
\N 因为我已拣选他，以使他会命令他之后他的儿女和他的家室通过行正确而公正的事来信守耶和华的道路，为了耶和华能将祂已应许的带给亚伯拉罕。”

% Then the LORD said, “The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is great. Because their sin is so grievous,

% Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will You really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
\N 亚伯拉罕向前一步并说，“祢真的会将义人与恶人一同扫除吗？
% What if there are fifty righteous ones in the city? Will You really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous ones who are there?

% Far be it from You to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Will not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?”
\N 祢绝不会做这种事---将义人与恶人一同杀掉，以使义人和恶人被相仿对待。祢绝不会！难道全地的审判者不做正确的事？”

% So the LORD replied, “If I find fifty righteous ones within the city of Sodom, on their account I will spare the whole place.”

% “Very well,” he answered, “I will grant this request as well, and will not demolish the town you indicate.
\N “非常好，”他回答，“我也会准予这个请求，而不会覆灭你所指的小镇。
% Hurry! Run there quickly, for I cannot do anything until you reach it.” That is why the town was called Zoar.
\N 赶快！快速跑到那里，因为在你抵达它之前我无法做任何事。”这是为何这小镇被称为琐珥。

% And by the time the sun had risen over the land, Lot had reached Zoar.
\N 而在太阳升起在这土地之上时，罗得已抵达琐珥。

% The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
\subsection*{索多玛和蛾摩拉的毁灭}

% Then the LORD rained down sulfur and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah—from the LORD out of the heavens.
\N 然后耶和华使硫磺和火雨落在索多玛和蛾摩拉上---来自诸天源自耶和华。
% Thus He destroyed these cities and the entire plain, including all the inhabitants of the cities and everything that grew on the ground.
\N 因此祂摧毁了这些城市和全平原，包括城市的所有居民和生长在地面的一切。

% But Lot’s wife looked back, and she became a pillar of salt.
\N 但是罗得的妻子回看，而她变成了一根盐柱。

% Early the next morning, Abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the LORD.
\N 第二天清早，亚伯拉罕起身并返回他曾站在耶和华面前的地方。
% He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw the smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace.
\N 他俯瞰索多玛和蛾摩拉和平原的所有土地，而他看见那土地冒出的烟，像从熔炉冒出的烟一样。

% So when God destroyed the cities of the plain, He remembered Abraham, and He brought Lot out of the catastrophe that destroyed the cities where he had lived.
\N 所以当上帝摧毁平原的城市时，祂记得亚伯拉罕，而祂将罗得从那摧毁他曾生活的城市的浩劫中带出。

% Lot and His Daughters
\subsection*{罗得和他的女儿们}

% Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains—for he was afraid to stay in Zoar—where they lived in a cave.
\N 罗得和他两个女儿离开琐珥并安家在山中---因为他害怕呆在琐珥---那里他们住在一个洞穴中。

% One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us, as is the custom over all the earth.
\N 一天大女儿对小女儿说，“我们的父亲年老，而在这土地上没有男人来和我们同寝，而这是全地之上的习俗。
    \footnote{
        和男人结婚生子是世俗的规矩。
    }
% Come, let us get our father drunk with wine so we can sleep with him and preserve his line.”
\N 来，让我们将我们的父亲用酒灌注，那么我们就能与他同寝并保守他的支脉。”

% So that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the firstborn went in and slept with her father; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up.
\N 所以那晚她们用酒将她们的父亲灌醉，而长女进去并与她父亲同寝；当她躺下或当她起身时他都毫无意识。

% The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let us get him drunk with wine again tonight so you can go in and sleep with him and we can preserve our father’s line.”
\N 第二天大女儿对小女儿说，“看，我昨晚与我父亲同寝。让我们今晚再次将他灌醉，那么你就能进去并与他同寝，而我们就能保守我们父亲的支脉。”

% So again that night they got their father drunk with wine, and the younger daughter went in and slept with him; he was not aware when she lay down or when she got up.
\N 所以那晚她们再次用酒将她们的父亲灌醉，而小女儿进去并与她父亲同寝；当她躺下或当她起身时他都毫无意识。

% Thus both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father.
\N 因而罗得的俩女儿都由她们的父亲怀了孕。
% The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the father of the Moabites of today. 
\N 大女儿生下一个儿子并给他取名摩押。他是今天摩押人的父亲。
% The younger daughter also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi. He is the father of the Ammonites of today.
\N 小女儿也生下一个儿子，而她给他取名便亚米。他是今天亚扪人的父亲。

% Abraham, Sarah, and Abimelech
\subsection*{亚伯拉罕、撒拉、和亚比米勒}

% Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar,
\N 现在亚伯拉罕从那里旅行到尼革夫的区域并在加低斯和书珥之间安家。当他呆在基拉耳时，
% Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.
\N 亚伯拉罕说他的妻子撒拉，“她是我的妹妹。”所以基拉耳王亚比米勒使撒拉被带给她。

% One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”
\N 然而，一天晚上，上帝在一个梦中临到亚比米勒并告诉他，“因为你带来的这女人你死期已至，因为她是一个已婚妇女。”

% Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?
\N 现在亚比米勒未曾亲近她，所以他回复，“主啊，祢会摧毁一族即使它是无辜的吗？
% Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”
\N 难道不是亚伯拉罕告诉我，‘她是我的妹妹’？她自己也说，‘他是我的哥哥。’我以我内心的正直和我双手的无辜做的这事。”

% Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her.
\N 然后上帝在梦中对亚比米勒说，“是的，我知道你以清洁的良心做的这，而所以我已使你避开对我犯罪。这是为何我不让你触碰她。
% Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.”
\N 现在将那人的妻子返还，因为他是一个先知；他会为你祷告而你就会存活。但如果你不归还她，要意识到你无疑会死---你和所有属于你的人。”

% Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified.
\N 第二天清早，亚比米勒起身并召集他所有仆人；而当他像他们描述所有已发生的，众人惊恐。

% Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.”
\N 然后亚比米勒召唤亚伯拉罕并问，“你对我们做了什么？我如何已对你犯罪，以致你将如此惊人的罪行带给我和我的国度？你已对我做了不该做的事情。”
% Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?”
\N 亚比米勒还问亚伯拉罕，“什么促使你做这样的事？”

% Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.’ 
\N 亚伯拉罕回复，“我自以为，‘在这地方无疑不敬畏上帝。他们会为了我的妻子而杀我。’
% Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became my wife.
\N 此外，她真的是我的妹妹，我父亲的女儿---但不是我母亲的女儿---而她成为了我的妻子。
% So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”
\N 所以当上帝使我离开我父亲的住所旅行时，我对撒拉说，‘你能这样展示对我的忠诚：无论我们去哪里，说到我，“他是我的哥哥”’”

% So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him.
\N 所以亚比米勒带了牛羊、男仆和女仆，而他将它们给了亚伯拉罕并将他的妻子撒拉归还给他。
% And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.”
\N 而亚比米勒说，“看，我的土地在你面前。在任何地方随心所欲安家。”
% And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.”
\N 而他对撒拉说。“看看，我正将一千块银子给你的哥哥。这是你在所有与你一起的人面前的昭雪；你被完全洗清。”

% Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children—
\N 然后亚伯拉罕向上帝祷告，而上帝治愈了亚比米勒和他的妻子以及他的女仆们，以使她们能再次生儿女---
% for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household.
\N 因为为了亚伯拉罕的妻子撒拉，耶和华已完全将在亚比米勒家室中的所有子宫关闭。

% The Birth of Isaac
\subsection*{以撒诞生}

% Now the LORD attended to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised.
\N 现在耶和华眷顾撒拉如祂已说的，而耶和华为撒拉做了祂已应许的。
% So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised.
\N 所以撒拉受孕并为亚伯拉罕在他老龄时生了一个儿子，正是在上帝已应许的时间。

% And Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore to him.
\N 而亚伯拉罕将名字以撒给了撒拉为他生的这个儿子。
% When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.
\N 当他的儿子以撒八天大时，亚伯拉罕为他施割礼，如上帝已命令他的。
% Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
\N 亚伯拉罕一百岁当他的儿子以撒为他出生时。

% Then Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.”
\N 然后撒拉说，“上帝已使我欢笑，而每个听说这的人都会与我同笑。”
% She added, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”
\N 她补充说，“谁曾会告诉亚伯拉罕：撒拉会抚育儿女？我却已为他在他老龄时生了一个儿子。”

% So the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.
\N 所以那孩子成长并断了奶，而亚伯拉罕在以撒断奶的那日举办了一场盛大的筵席。

% Sarah Turns against Hagar
\subsection*{撒拉对夏甲反目}

% But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking her son,
\N 但撒拉看见埃及人夏甲为亚伯拉罕已生的儿子在嘲笑她的儿子，
% and she said to Abraham, “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!”
\N 而她对亚伯拉罕说，“驱逐那仆女和她的儿子，因为那仆女的儿子绝不会与我的儿子以撒一同有份于这遗产。”

% Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael.
\N 现在这问题使亚伯拉罕忧痛极大，因为这关涉他的儿子以实玛利。
% But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to everything that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.
\N 但上帝对亚伯拉罕说，“不要忧痛于这男孩和你的女仆。听从撒拉告诉你的一切，因为是藉着以撒你的后嗣才会被计数。
% But I will also make a nation of the slave woman’s son, because he is your offspring.”
\N 但我也会使这仆女的儿子成为一邦，因为他是你的后嗣。”

% Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba.
\N 在清早，亚伯拉罕起身，带了饼和一皮袋水，将它们放在夏甲的肩膀上，并将她与那男孩一起送走。她离开而在别是巴的旷野徘徊。
% When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes.
\N 当皮袋中的水喝光时，她将男孩留在一株灌木下。
% Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!” And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept.
\N 然后她离去并在附近坐下，大约一箭之遥，因为她说，“我无法承受看见那男孩死去！”而她坐在附近时，她放声而泣。

% Then God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies.
\N 然后上帝听见那男孩的声音，而上帝的使者从天国向夏甲呼唤，“怎么啦，夏甲？不要害怕，因为上帝已在他所躺之处听见男孩的声音。
% Get up, lift up the boy, and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”
\N 起身，抱起那男孩，并用手牵着他，因为我会使他成为一个伟大的邦国。”
% Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
\N 然后上帝打开了她的眼睛，而她看见一口水井。所以她走去将皮带装满水并给那男孩喝。

% And God was with the boy, and he grew up and settled in the wilderness and became a great archer.
\N 而上帝与那男孩同在，而他长大并在旷野中安家而成为一个伟大的射手。
% And while he was dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
\N 而当他在巴兰的旷野中栖居时，他的母亲从埃及的土地上为他得了一个妻子。

% The Covenant at Beersheba
\subsection*{别是巴协定}

% At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do.
\N 在那时亚比米勒和他军队的指挥官非各对亚伯拉罕说，“上帝在你做的所有中都与你同在。
% Now, therefore, swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or descendants. Show to me and to the country in which you reside the same kindness that I have shown to you.”
\N 现在，因此，在这里在上帝面前对我发誓你不会虚假地对付我或我的儿女或后代。向我并向你定居的国家展示我已展示给你的相同的良善。”

% And Abraham replied, “I swear it.”
\N 而亚伯拉罕回复，“我对此发誓。”

% But when Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized,
\N 但当亚伯拉罕向亚比米勒抱怨亚比米勒的仆人们已霸占一口井时，
% Abimelech replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me, so I have not heard about it until today.”
\N 亚比米勒回复，“我不知道谁做的这事。你不告诉我，所以我未曾听说这事直到今天。”

% So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.
\N 所以亚伯拉罕带了牛羊并将它们给了亚比米勒，而两人立了一个协定。
% Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock,
\N 亚伯拉罕将七只母羊羔从羊群分开，
% and Abimelech asked him, “Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?”
\N 而亚比米勒问他，“你为何分别这七只母羊羔？”

% He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand as my witness that I dug this well.”
\N 他回复，“你要从我手中接受这七只母羊羔，作为我挖这井的一个见证。”
% So that place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them swore an oath.
\N 所以那地方被称为别是巴，因为他们两人在那里发了一个誓言。
% After they had made the covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up and returned to the land of the Philistines.
\N 在他们在别是巴立下协定后，亚比米勒和他军队的指挥官非各起身并返回非利士人的土地。

% And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.
\N 而亚伯拉罕在别是巴栽了一棵怪柳树，而他在那里求靠耶和华、永恒上帝的名。
% And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
\N 而亚伯拉罕在非利士人的土地上定居了很长时间。

% “Take your son,” God said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you.”
\N “带着你的儿子，”上帝说，“你惟一的儿子以撒，你所爱的，并去到摩利亚之地。到那里，在一座我会展示给你的山上，将他作为燔祭奉上。”

% So Abraham got up early the next morning, saddled his donkey, and took along two of his servants and his son Isaac. He split the wood for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had designated.
\N 所以亚伯拉罕第二天清早出发，给他的驴装上鞍，并带了他两个仆人和他的儿子以撒一道。他为燔祭劈了柴就出发到上帝已指示的地方。

% On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
\N 在第三天，亚伯拉罕仰望并看见了远处那个地方。

\N “与驴呆在一起，”亚伯拉罕告诉他的仆人们。“我和这男孩会去到那里敬拜，而然后我们会返回到你们这。”

% Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. He himself carried the fire and the sacrificial knife, and the two of them walked on together.

% “The fire and the wood are here,” said Isaac, “but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
“火和柴在这，”以撒说，“可燔祭的羔羊在哪呢？”

% Abraham answered, “God Himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” And the two walked on together.
\N 亚伯拉罕回答，“我的儿子，上帝会亲自为燔祭提供羔羊。”然后两人一起前行。

% When they arrived at the place God had designated, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac and placed him on the altar, atop the wood.

% “Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him,” said the angel, “for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.”
\N “不要对那男孩下手或对他做任何事，”使者说，“因为现在我知道你敬畏上帝，因为你未曾对我扣留你惟一的儿子。”

% Then Abraham looked up and saw behind him a ram in a thicket, caught by its horns. So he went and took the ram and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
\N 然后亚伯拉罕仰望并看见在他身后有一只公绵羊被它的角卡在树丛中。所以他走去取了那公绵羊，并将它代替他的儿子作为燔祭奉上。
% And Abraham called that place The LORD Will Provide. So to this day it is said, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.”
\N 而亚伯拉罕称那地方“耶和华会提供”。所以到今日都有人说，“在耶和华的山上会被提供。”

% And the angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time,
\N 而耶和华的使者从天国向亚伯拉罕第二次呼唤，
% saying, “By Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your only son,

% Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife and said to the Hittites,
\N 然后亚伯拉罕从他亡妻身旁起身并对赫人说，
% “I am a foreigner and an outsider among you. Give me a burial site among you so that I can bury my dead.”
\N “我在你们中间是一个异邦人和一个外人。请在你们中间给我一个埋葬的地点以使我能埋葬我的死人。”

% to sell me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him sell it to me in your presence for full price, so that I may have a burial site.”
\N 将属于他的麦比拉洞穴卖给我；它在他田地的尽头。让他将其当着你们的面以足价卖给我，以使我能有一个埋葬地点。”

% Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth. So in the presence of all the Hittites who had come to the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham,

% So Ephron’s field at Machpelah near Mamre, the cave that was in it, and all the trees within the boundaries of the field were deeded over

\N 耶和华，天之上帝，祂将我从我父亲的家族和我的故土带出，祂对我讲话并以誓言应许我，说，‘我会将这土地赐给你的后嗣’---祂会在你前面派祂的使者以使你能从那里为我的儿子取一位妻子。
% And if the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are released from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there.”

% So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
\N 所以仆人将他的手放在他的主人亚伯拉罕的大腿下，并向他就此事要发了誓言。

% Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels and departed with all manner of good things from his master in hand. And he set out for Nahor’s hometown in Aram-naharaim.
\N 然后那仆人带了他主人的十只骆驼，手里带着他主人各样美物离去。而他向拿鹤在亚兰拿哈林

\N 现在愿这样的事发生：我对那个女孩说，‘请放下你的水罐使我能饮，’而她回应，‘喝吧，我还会饮你的骆驼’---让她成为祢为祢的仆人以撒已指定的那位。由此我会知道祢已将良善展示给我的主人。”

% Rebekah Is Chosen
\subsection*{利百加被选}

% Before the servant had finished praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor.
\N 在那仆人结束祷告之前，利百加就在她肩上带着她的水罐出来了。她是密迦、亚伯拉罕兄弟拿鹤的妻子的儿子彼土利的女儿。
% Now the girl was very beautiful, a virgin who had not had relations with any man. She went down to the spring, filled her jar, and came up again.
\N 现在那女孩非常漂亮，是一个未曾与任何男人同房的童女。她下到泉水那里，灌满她的水罐，又再次上来。

% So the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jar.”
\N 所以那仆人跑去会见她并说，“请让我从你的水罐喝点水。”

% “Drink, my lord,” she replied, and she quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink.
\N “喝吧，我主，”她回复，而她快速将她的水罐放到她手上，并给他喝。

% After she had given him a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels, until they have had enough to drink.”
\N 在她给他喝完之后，她说，“我还会给你的骆驼汲水，直到它们喝足为止。”
% And she quickly emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw water, until she had drawn water for all his camels.
\N 而她快速将她的水罐的水全倒进水槽中并跑回水井去汲水，直到她给他所有的骆驼都汲了水。

% Meanwhile, the man watched her silently to see whether or not the LORD had made his journey a success.
\N 同时，那人静静地察看她以看耶和华是否已使他此行成功。

% And after the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring weighing a beka, and two gold bracelets for her wrists weighing ten shekels.
\N 而在骆驼喝完水之后，他拿出一个重一贝卡

\N “你是谁的女儿？”他问。“请告诉我，在你父亲的住所有余地为我们过夜吗？”

% She replied, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son that Milcah bore to Nahor.”
\N 她回复，“我是彼土利、密迦为拿鹤生的儿子的女儿，”
% Then she added, “We have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place for you to spend the night.”
\N 然后她补充说，“我们有充裕的麦秆和饲料，也有为你过夜的地方。”

% Then the man bowed down and worshiped the LORD,
\N 然后那人下拜并敬拜耶和华，
% saying, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not withheld His kindness and faithfulness from my master. As for me, the LORD has led me on the journey to the house of my master’s relatives.”
\N 说，“耶和华、我主人亚伯拉罕的上帝是当受崇拜的！祂未曾向我的主人扣留祂的良善和信实。至于我，耶和华已带领我在到我主人亲戚住所的途中。”

% The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things.
\N 那女孩跑去把这些事情告诉了她母亲家室的人。
% Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, and he rushed out to the man at the spring.
\N 现在，利百加有个哥哥名叫拉班，而他冲出去到在泉水边那人那里。
% As soon as he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and heard Rebekah’s words, “The man said this to me,” he went and found the man standing by the camels near the spring.
\N 他一看见那环，和他妹妹手腕上的镯子，并听见利百加的言词，“那人对我说了这话，”他就去找到了泉水边站在骆驼旁的那人。

% “Come, you who are blessed by the LORD,” said Laban. “Why are you standing out here? I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
\N “来，你这被耶和华祝福的人，”拉班说。“你为何站在外面这里？我已预备住所也为骆驼预备了地方。”
% So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded. Straw and feed were brought to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of his companions.
\N 所以那人来到住所，并骆驼被卸下了。麦秆和饲料被送到骆驼那，水也被送来洗他和他同伴们的脚。

% Then a meal was set before the man, but he said, “I will not eat until I have told you what I came to say.”
\N 然后饭菜摆在那人面前，但他说，“在我告诉你们我来要说的事之前我不会吃。”

% So Laban said, “Please speak.”
所以拉班说，“请讲。”

% “I am Abraham’s servant,” he replied.
\N “我是亚伯拉罕的仆人，”他回复。
% “The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become rich. He has given him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, menservants and maidservants, camels and donkeys.
\N “耶和华已大大祝福我的主人，而他已变得富有。祂已赐给他牛羊、金银、男仆和女仆、骆驼和驴。
% My master’s wife Sarah has borne him a son in her old age, and my master has given him everything he owns.
\N 我主人的妻子撒拉已在她老龄时为他生了一个儿子，而我的主人已将他拥有的一切都给了他。

% but you shall go to my father’s house and to my kindred to take a wife for my son.’

% Then I asked my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’
\N 然后我问我的主人，‘倘若那女人不会与我回来呢？’

% And he told me, ‘The LORD, before whom I have walked, will send His angel with you and make your journey a success, so that you may take a wife for my son from my kindred and from my father’s house. 
\N 而他告诉我，‘耶和华，我已行在祂面前，祂会派祂的使者与你同在并使你此行成功，以使你能从我的亲属和我父亲的家族为我的儿子取一位妻子。
% And when you go to my kindred, if they refuse to give her to you, then you will be released from my oath.’
\N 而当你去到我亲属那，如果他们拒绝将她给你，那么你会被免除我这个誓言。’

% So when I came to the spring today, I prayed: O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if only You would make my journey a success!
\N 所以当我今天来到泉水这，我祷告：耶和华啊，我主人亚伯拉罕的上帝，但愿祢会使我此行成功！
% Here I am, standing beside this spring. Now if a maiden comes out to draw water and I say to her, ‘Please let me drink a little water from your jar,’

\N 而她回复，‘喝吧，而我还会给你的骆驼汲水，’愿她是那耶和华已为我主人的儿子指定的女人。

% And before I had finished praying in my heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’
\N 而在我结束我心中祷告之前，利百加就正从那出来，她肩上带着她的水罐，而她下到泉水那并汲水。所以我对她说，‘请给我水喝。’

% She quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I will water your camels as well.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels.
\N 她快速从她肩上放下她的水罐并说，‘喝吧，而我还会饮你的骆驼。’所以我喝了，而她也饮了骆驼。

% Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’
\N 然后我问她，‘你是谁的女儿？’

% She replied, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her wrists.
她回复，‘拿鹤的儿子、密迦为他生的彼土利的女儿。’所以我将环放在她鼻子上并将镯子放在她手腕上。
% Then I bowed down and worshiped the LORD; and I blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right road to take the granddaughter of my master’s brother for his son.
\N 然后我下拜并敬拜耶和华；而我崇拜耶和华、我主人亚伯拉罕的上帝，祂带领我在为他的儿子取我主人兄弟的孙女的正路上。

% Now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me; but if not, let me know, so that I may go elsewhere.”
\N 现在如果你们愿向我主人展示良善和信实，请告诉我；但如果不，请让我知道，以使我能去其他地方。”

% Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the LORD; we have no choice in the matter.
\N 拉班和彼土利回答：“这来自耶和华；我们在这事上没有选择。
% Rebekah is here before you. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, just as the LORD has decreed.”
\N 利百加就在你面前。带她走，而让她成为你主人儿子的妻子，正如耶和华已降旨的。”

% When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed down to the ground before the LORD.

% Then he brought out jewels of silver and gold, and articles of clothing, and he gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother.

% When they got up the next morning, he said, “Send me on my way to my master.”
当他们第二天起身，他说，“送我上路回我主人那。”

% But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl remain with us ten days or so. After that, she may go.”
\N 但她哥哥和母亲说，“让这女孩留在我们身边十天左右。之后，她才能走。”

% But he replied, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has made my journey a success. Send me on my way so that I may go to my master.”
\N 但他回复，“不要耽搁我，因为耶和华已使我此行成功。送我上路以使我能去到我主人那。”

% So they said, “We will call the girl and ask her opinion.”

% and that night the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of My servant Abraham.”
\N 而那晚耶和华向他显现并说，“我是你父亲亚伯拉罕的上帝。不要害怕，因为我与你同在。我会祝福你并因我仆人亚伯拉罕的缘故使你的后代倍增。”

% So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD, and he pitched his tent there. His servants also dug a well there.
\N 所以以撒在那里建造了一座祭坛并求靠耶和华的名，而他在那里搭起他的帐篷。他的仆人也在那里挖了一口水井。

% Isaac’s Covenant with Abimelech

% “Why have you come to me?” Isaac asked them. “You hated me and sent me away.”
\N “你们为何来我这里？”以撒问他们。“你们恨我并将我送走。”

% “We can plainly see that the LORD has been with you,” they replied. “We recommend that there should now be an oath between us and you. Let us make a covenant with you
\N “我们能明明白白地看见耶和华已与你同在，”他们回复。“我们推荐现在我们之间应该有个誓言。让我们与你立一个协定
% that you will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have done only good to you, sending you on your way in peace. And now you are blessed by the LORD.”
以使你不会伤害我们，正如我们未曾伤害你而只对你行好事，和平地送你上路。而现在你被耶和华祝福。”

% So Isaac prepared a feast for them, and they ate and drank.
\N 所以以撒为他们预备了一顿盛宴，而他们又吃又喝。
% And they got up early the next morning and swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left him in peace.

% Isaac Blesses Jacob
\subsection*{以撒祝福雅各}

% When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see, he called his older son Esau and said to him, “My son.”
\N 当以撒年老而他的眼睛是如此昏花以致他不再能看见，他将他的大儿子以扫叫来并对他说，“我的儿子。”

% “Here I am,” Esau replied.
“我在这里，”以扫回复。

% “Look,” said Isaac, “I am now old, and I do not know the day of my death.
\N “看，”以撒说，“我现在年老，而我不知道我死的日子。
% Take your weapons—your quiver and bow—and go out into the field to hunt some game for me.
\N 带上你的武器---你的箭囊和弓---并外出到田野中为我猎取一些野味。
% Then prepare a tasty dish that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I may bless you before I die.”
\N 然后预备一道我所爱的可口的菜肴并将它带给我吃，以使我能在我死之前祝福你。”

% Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac told his son Esau. So when Esau went into the field to hunt game and bring it back,
\N 现在利百加正听到以撒告诉他儿子以扫的事情。所以当以扫走入田野去猎取野味并将它带回时，
% Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Behold, I overheard your father saying to your brother Esau,
\N 利百加对她的儿子雅各说，“看啊，我无意中听见你父亲对你的哥哥以扫说，
% ‘Bring me some game and prepare me a tasty dish to eat, so that I may bless you in the presence of the LORD before I die.’
\N ‘带给我一些野味并未我预备一道可口的菜肴吃，以使在我死之前，我能在耶和华的临在中祝福你。’

% Now, my son, listen to my voice and do exactly as I tell you.
\N 现在，我的儿子，听从我的话并照我吩咐你的做。
% Go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, so that I can make them into a tasty dish for your father—the kind he loves.
\N 出去到羊群那里给我带两只上好的小山羊，以使我能将它们为你父亲做成一道可口的菜肴---他所爱的那类。
% Then take it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.”
\N 然后将它拿给你父亲吃，以使他能在他死之前祝福你。”

% Jacob answered his mother Rebekah, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am smooth-skinned.
\N 雅各回答他的母亲利百加，“看，我哥哥以扫浑身是毛，但我皮肤光滑。
% What if my father touches me? Then I would be revealed to him as a deceiver, and I would bring upon myself a curse rather than a blessing.”
\N 倘若我父亲摸我呢？那么我就会在他面前被揭露而成了一个欺骗者，而我会给自己带来咒诅而不是祝福。”

% His mother replied, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey my voice and go get them for me.”
\N 他的母亲回复，“我的儿子，愿你的咒诅落在我身上。只要遵守我的话并去为我把他们拿来。”

% So Jacob went and got two goats and brought them to his mother, who made the tasty food his father loved. 
\N 所以雅各去取了两只山羊并将它们带个他的母亲，而她做了他父亲所爱的可口食物。
% And Rebekah took the finest clothes in the house that belonged to her older son Esau, and she put them on her younger son Jacob.
\N 而利百加取了属于她大儿子以扫的房子中最好的衣服，而她将它们穿在她小儿子雅各身上。
% She also put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
\N 她还将小山羊的皮戴在他的手上以及他光滑的脖子部分上。
% Then she handed her son Jacob the tasty food and bread she had made.
\N 然后她将她已做的可口食物和饼交给她的儿子雅各。

% So Jacob went to his father and said, “My father.”
\N 所以雅各去到他父亲那里并说，“我的父亲。”

% “Here I am!” he answered. “Which one are you, my son?”
“我在这里！”他回答。“我的儿子，你是哪一个？”

% Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.”
\N 雅各对他父亲说，“我是以扫，你的长子。我已按你吩咐我的做了。请坐起并吃一些我的野味，以使你能祝福我。”

% But Isaac asked his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?”
\N 但以撒问他的儿子，“我的儿子，你如何如此快速地打到它呢？”

% “Because the LORD your God brought it to me,” he replied.
“因为是耶和华你的上帝将它带给了我，”他回复。

% Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau, or not?”
\N 然后以撒对雅各说，“请靠近一些，使我能摸你，我的儿子。你真的是我的儿子以撒，还是不是？”

% So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, who touched him and said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.”
\N 所以雅各靠近他的父亲以撒，而以撒摸了他并说，“声音是雅各的声音，手却是以扫的手。”
% Isaac did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him.
\N 以撒未认出他，因为他的手和他哥哥以扫的一样多毛；所以以撒祝福了他。

% Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?”
\N 他再次问，“你真的是我的儿子以扫？”

% And he replied, “I am.”
而他回复，“我是。”

% “Serve me,” said Isaac, “and let me eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.”
\N “伺候我，”以撒说，“让我吃一些我儿子的野味，以使我能祝福你。”

% Jacob brought it to him, and he ate; then he brought him wine, and he drank.
雅各将其递给他，他就吃了；然后他将酒递给他，他就喝了。

% Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come near and kiss me, my son.”
\N 然后他父亲以撒对他说，“我的儿子，请靠近并亲吻我。”

% So he came near and kissed him. When Isaac smelled his clothing, he blessed him and said:
\N 所以他靠近并亲吻他。当以撒闻了他的衣物，他祝福他并说：

% “Ah, the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the LORD has blessed.
“啊，我儿子的味道像一片耶和华已祝福的田野的味道一样。

% May God give to you the dew of heaven and the richness of the earth — an abundance of grain and new wine.
\N 愿上帝赐给你天国的露水和大地的丰富---盛于谷物和新酒。

% May peoples serve you and nations bow down to you. May you be the master of your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed, and those who bless you be blessed.”
\N 愿众民服侍你而众邦向你下拜。愿你成为你兄弟们的主人，并愿你母亲的子嗣向你下拜。愿那些咒诅你的人被咒诅，而那些祝福你的人蒙福。”

% Esau’s Lost Hope
\subsection*{以扫失去希望}

% As soon as Isaac had finished blessing him and Jacob had left his father’s presence, his brother Esau returned from the hunt.
\N 以撒一结束祝福他而雅各刚离开他父亲的面前，他的哥哥以扫就从狩猎归来。
% He too made some tasty food, brought it to his father, and said to him, “My father, sit up and eat of your son’s game, so that you may bless me.”
\N 他也做了一些可口的食物，将它带给他的父亲，并对他说，“我的父亲，坐起并吃点你儿子的野味，以使你能祝福我。”

% But his father Isaac replied, “Who are you?”
\N 但他的父亲以撒回复，“你是谁？”

% “I am Esau, your firstborn son,” he answered.
“我是以扫，你的头生的儿子，”他回答。

% Isaac began to tremble violently and said, “Who was it, then, who hunted the game and brought it to me? Before you came in, I ate it all and blessed him—and indeed, he will be blessed!”
\N 以撒开始剧烈地战兢并说，“那刚才猎取野味并带给我的是谁？在你进来之前，我将它全都吃了并祝福了他---而的确，他会被祝福！”

% When Esau heard his father’s words, he let out a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, O my father!”
\N 当以扫听见他父亲的言词，他发出了一声高亢而苦涩的哭嚎并对他父亲说，“我的父亲啊，也祝福我吧！”

% But Isaac replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”
\N 但以撒回复，“你的弟弟诡诈地来并取了你的祝福。”

% So Esau declared, “Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has cheated me twice. He took my birthright, and now he has taken my blessing.” Then he asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?”
\N 所以以扫宣告，“他不正是名叫雅各吗？因为他已蒙骗我两次。他取了我的长子权，而现在他已取了我的祝福。”然后他说，“你难道未为我留存一份祝福吗？”

% But Isaac answered Esau: “Look, I have made him your master and given him all his relatives as servants; I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What is left that I can do for you, my son?”
\N 但以撒问以扫：“看，我已使他做你的主人并将他所有的亲戚给他做仆人；我已以谷物和新酒给养他。我的儿子，我能为你做的还剩什么呢？”

% Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, O my father!” Then Esau wept aloud.
\N 以扫对他的父亲说，“我的父亲，你只有一个祝福吗？我的父亲啊，也祝福我吧！”然后以扫放声哭泣。

% His father Isaac answered him: “Behold, your dwelling place shall be away from the richness of the land,away from the dew of heaven above.
\N 他的父亲以撒回答他：“看啊，你栖居地必远离土地的丰富，远离天国之上的露水。

% You shall live by the sword and serve your brother. But when you rebel, you will tear his yoke from your neck.”
\N 你必靠刀剑为生而服侍你的弟弟。但当你反叛时，你会从你的脖子撕开他的轭。”

% Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
\N 以扫对雅各怀恨在心因为他父亲已给他的祝福。而以扫在他心里说，“为我父亲哀悼的日子近在眼前；那时我会杀掉我的弟弟雅各。”

% When the words of her older son Esau were relayed to Rebekah, she sent for her younger son Jacob and told him, “Look, your brother Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you.
\N 当她大儿子以扫的言词传到了利百加时，她派人请她的小儿子雅各并告诉他，“看，你哥哥以扫以谋划杀你来慰藉自己。
% So now, my son, obey my voice and flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran.
\N 所以现在，我的儿子，遵守我的话而立即逃到我在哈兰的哥哥拉班那里。
% Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s fury subsides—
\N 与他呆一阵，直到你哥哥的怒气消退---
% until your brother’s rage against you wanes and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose both of you in one day?”
\N 直到你哥哥对你的怒气减弱并忘记你对他已做的事。然后我会派人请你并将你从那里带回。为何我要在一日之内失去你们两个？”

% Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am weary of my life because of these Hittite women. If Jacob takes a Hittite wife from among them, what good is my life?”
\N 然后利百加对以撒说，“我因这些赫人的女人身心疲惫。如果雅各从他们之中取一个赫人妻子，我的生命有何善处呢？”

% Genesis 28

%“Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your mother’s father Bethuel, and take a wife from among the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother.
\N “立即去巴旦亚兰，到你母亲的父亲彼土利的家族，并从你母亲的哥哥，拉班的女儿之中取一位妻子。
% May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a company of peoples.
\N 愿上帝全能者祝福你而使你富有果实且使你倍增，以使你能成为一个族群。

\N 并愿祂将亚伯拉罕的祝福赐给你和你的后代，以使你能占有你作为一个异邦人所栖居的土地，上帝赐给亚伯拉罕的土地。”
